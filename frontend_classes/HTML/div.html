             The oldest classical British and Latin writing had little or no space between words and
             could be written in boustrophedon (alternating directions).time, text direction 
             (left to right) became standardized.Word dividers and terminal punctuation became common. 
             The first way to divide sentences into groupswas the original paragraphos, similar to an underscore 
             at the beginning of the new group.[1] The Greek parágraphos evolved into the pilcrow (¶), which in English
             manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences.
